\section{Theoretical Background of Wakefields and Impedances}

%
% Explaination of the concept of wakefields (the source and witness particle), oscillating electric fields
% induced by a charged particle. Longitudinal and Transverse wakefields

\begin{itemize}
\item{Wakes}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Introduction to the electromagnetic field of charged particle moving in free space}
\item{Field of a particle in a perfectly conducting pipe - method of image currents}
\item{Place a witness particle distance s behind source particle and deduce electric field as seen by this particle}
\item{normalise this by the source particle charge to give the wakepotential}
\item{And again by the source particle charge and current profile to acquire the loss factor}
\item{Longitudinal field predominantly}
\item{Introduce the Panowsky-Wenzel theorem covering transverse field - Transverse wakes}
\end{itemize}
\item{Impedance}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Firstly mention the commonality of frequency dependent material properties - ferrite permeability, permitivitty determined by conductivity/frequency in conductors/dielectrics/skin depth}
\item{Fourier transform of wakefield into the convolution of the beam current spectrum and the impedance}
\item{Again Panowsky-Wenzel for impedance}
\item{Discussion of the transverse impedance - in particular the general definition of an impedance (n-th order current interacting with an m-th order field)}
\item{Define dipolar/driving and quadrupolar/detuning impedance. In addition constant transverse impedance term}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Resistive Wall Impedance}

\begin{itemize}
\item{Return to simple axisymmetric geometry concerning a finite conductivity of the wall}
\item{Derive in frequency domain - then have impedance. Give an example wakefield of a good conductor (copper), bad conductor (graphite), non-conductor (ferrite)}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Geometric Impedance}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Derive the field pattern for a pillbox cavity - Oscillating fields with a characteristic frequency of some multiple of the lowest eigenfrequency}
\end{itemize}
\section{Examples of Effects}

\subsection{Single Bunch and Coupled Bunch Instabilities}

\begin{itemize}
\item{Take references to introductory section on beam dynamics - longitudinal and transverse oscillations}
\item{Introduce bunch oscillation spectra - resonance diagrams for transverse motion, longitudinal spectra}
\item{Instabilities by resonance crossing, LMCI, TMCI, headtail instabilities, TCBI}
\item{Section on landau damping/transverse dampers? Other way to counter large impedances.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example of LMCI with Broadband and Space Charge Impedances Studied with HEADTAIL}

% Theory of LMCI (potential well distortion and microwave instability)
% Simulations with BB, SC and BB/SC impedances
% Comparison of different impedances and their production of different stability criteria
