\begin{itemize}

\item{Summary of different beam screen designs - Where possible include discussion about the reduction of the voltage build up on each screen conductor}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Screen conductors all of the same length with capactive coupling at one end - Show how increasing the number of screen conductors really helps to reduce the BCI}
\item{Screen conductors with a tapering of the length, with the longest at the side towards the ground plate and the shortest towards the HV plate}
\item{Alternating lengths of long and short screen conductors}
\item{Having the screen conductors in closed slots in the ceramic tube}
\item{The addition of small conducting spheres to the ends of the screen conductors to reduce the high fields at the conductor ends}
\item{Thicker ceramic at the capacitively coupled end of the beam screen to reduce the field gradient}
\item{Alternative beam screen design - Most screen conductor capactively coupled at both ends, with two connected to the beam pipe at one end. Aim to reduce the potential on all conductors by conductively connecting them at the capactively coupled end}
\item{Stepping the external metallization away from the ceramic tube at the ends of the screen conductors. The metallization will be removed and a conducting pipe placed there instead - different step out dstances are investigated}
\end{enumerate}

\item{Heating estimates for all of the above}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Explain completely the methods of estimating the power losses here - bunch intensity, number of bunches, bunch length, distribution}
\item{Note the benefits of increasing the bunch length for the resonances with 15 screen conductors}
\item{Summary charts of the beam induced heating for the others, and plots illustrating how the changes in bunch length changes the power loss}
\item{Impedance profiles of all of the above - longitudinal predominantly}
\item{Some judgement on which is most appropriate for an impedance point of view}
\item{Comments on the improvements made to existing magnets already - 19 screen conductors}
\end{enumerate}
