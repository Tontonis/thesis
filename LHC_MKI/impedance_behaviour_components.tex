\begin{enumerate}
\item{Start with a simple c - core ferrite magnet}
\item{Add a ceramic tube}
\item{Add screen conductors in internal side - Brief interlude about the limitations this places on the magnet rise time due to creating a Faraday cage}
\item{Add the capacitive coupling - Different lengths of overlap to demonstrate that this controls the frequency of the resonances. Also lengths of the screen conductors for lower resonances}
\item{Add the ferrite damping rings - damp resonances of length of screen conductor - not(!) overlap}
\item{Hopefully show that this is the dominant cause of the resonances}
\end{enumerate}
