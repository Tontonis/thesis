The work presented in this thesis assesses the physics potential of central exclusive production at TeV energies. 
The ExHuME event generator was developed and this allowed the Durham model of central exclusive production to be fully simulated for the first time. Using ExHuME, 
the dependence of the calculation on the parton density functions was evaluated and the cross section was found to change by up to a factor of two.

The di-photon cross section at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was calculated to be observable by the ATLAS experiment using the currently proposed trigger if forward proton detectors were installed 420m downstream on either side of the interaction point. It was estimated that 2.1 events would be observed every year for a luminosity of 10$^{33}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and 17.4 events per year at a luminosity of 10$^{34}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$.

Central exclusive $H \rightarrow b \bar{b}$ production was evaluated assuming forward proton detectors will be installed at ATLAS. A series of exclusivity cuts were developed to reduce each of the backgrounds to a similar level to the signal. Despite this, it was found that the Standard Model Higgs boson is not observable in this channel. The analysis was repeated for two points in the intense coupling regime of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). It was found that the lightest Higgs boson is observable in the MSSM (with $m_A=130$GeV and tan$\beta=50$) if a new low transverse energy jet trigger is incorporated at ATLAS. It was found that the optimal luminosity for this study is $5\times$10$^{32}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ with 5 signal events observed each year. The significance of the observation was found to reach 3.0 after five years of data taking. 

Central exclusive di-jet production was investigated at the Tevatron. It was shown that the central exclusive events could be separated from the majority of the background using the standard di-jet mass fraction variable. Furthermore, it was found that the transverse energy distribution of the central exclusive jets could be used to distinguish between different theoretical models.
