I would like to start by thanking my supervisors, Fred Loebinger and Brian Cox, for the encouragement and support they have given me over the past three years. This has been a great project to be part of and I am grateful that they let me work on it in a way that suited me best. I would also like to thank Jeff Forshaw for patiently explaining the theory and for the words ``Well, why don't you just write your own Monte Carlo?". Thanks to James Monk, who then helped me do just that. Thanks also to PPARC for funding the studentship.

Everyone in the HEP group deserves a mention for making it an enjoyable place to work, but with space a factor I will limit myself (mainly) to those who occupied the ATLAS office - Sarah, Irina, Andres, Paul, James and Simon. I have not forgotten Chris and Will, they just deserve a special mention for always being available for skiing or the Belgian bar. Or both. Thanks to everyone who proof read any part of this thesis (far too many to mention). Thanks also, for various reasons, to Rob and Tim.

Away from the physics department, I would like to thank all those people who I have had the privilege to know during the last few years. Thanks to Conor, Rory, Mike, Fraser, Casey, Tom, McGreevy, Darragh, Avik, Adam and Chris for all the laughs. Thanks to my family (Di, Viv, Don) for their support. Special thanks to my Mum and Dad who have always believed the best of me, often despite evidence to the contrary! 

Finally, I would like to say a huge thank you to Aneela for all that she does for me. She is the person who  brightens up my day if anything goes wrong, be it large or small. She has supported me in every way for seven years and especially during the last few months when I have been writing this document. For this and more, I will always be grateful.
