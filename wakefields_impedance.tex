\section{Examples of Effects}

\subsection{Beam Induced Heating}

\subsection{Defining and Deriving Power Loss in Circular Accelerators}
\label{sec:power_loss}

When a charged particle interacts with an impedance it losses energy to generate the resulting wakefield. This is called the parasitic loss, and is generally defined as[ref Chao/Ng]

\begin{equation}
\Delta E = -2\pi e^{2}N_{b}\int^{\infty}_{-\infty} d\omega \left| \lambda \left( \omega \right)  \right|^{2} Z_{\parallel} \left( \omega \right)
\end{equation}

where $\Delta E$ is the energy loss per pass per particle, $e$ is the charge per particle, $N_{b}$, $\omega$ the frequency, $\lambda$ the line density of the bunch and $Z_{\parallel}$ the longitudinal impedance of the object being traversed.
																
Due to the decay of the wakefields induced by this energy loss, this energy must eventually be lost to the device causing the impedance (valid below the cutoff frequency of the machine beam pipe). Therefore we can assume that the energy loss from the particles is absorbed by the surrounding structure. Summing over all particles in a bunch we can therefore obtain a sum of the energy loss;

\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{bunch} = 2\pi \left( eN_{b}   \right)^{2} \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} d\omega \left| \lambda \left( \omega \right)  \right|^{2} Z_{\parallel} \left( \omega \right)
\end{equation}

As often we must deal with machines storing multiple bunches, for these we simply multiply the energy loss per bunch by the number of stored bunches to acquire the total energy loss per passage;

\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{bunches} = 2\pi \left( eN_{b}   \right)^{2}n_{bunch}\rho \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} d\omega \left| \lambda \left( \omega \right)  \right|^{2} Z_{\parallel} \left( \omega \right)
\end{equation}

where $n_{bunch}$ is the number of bunches in the machine assuming all bunches being equally spaced, and $\rho$ is the fraction of the machine occupied in operation. If we assume a revolution frequency $f_{rev}$ we thus get a power loss of;

\begin{align}
P_{loss}  = & \Delta E_{bunches} f_{rev}\nonumber \\  
 = & 2\pi f_{rev} \left( eN_{b}   \right)^{2}n_{bunch}\rho \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} d\omega \left| \lambda \left( \omega \right)  \right|^{2} Z_{\parallel} \left( \omega \right) \nonumber  \\ 
 = & 2\pi f_{rev} \left( eN_{b}   \right)^{2}n_{bunch}\rho \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} d\omega \left| \lambda \left( \omega \right)  \right|^{2} Z_{\parallel} \left( \omega \right) \nonumber \\
 = & 2\pi f_{rev} \left( eN_{b}   \right)^{2}n_{bunch}\rho \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} d\omega \left| \lambda \left( \omega \right)  \right|^{2} \left( \Re{}e \left( Z_{\parallel} \left( \omega\right) + \Im{}m Z_{\parallel} \left( \omega\right) \right) \right).
\end{align}
 
As $\Re{}e\left(Z_{\parallel} \left( \omega\right)\right)$ is an even function and $\Im{}m\left(Z_{\parallel} \left( \omega\right)\right)$ is an odd function, we see that

\begin{equation}
P_{loss}   =  \omega_{rev} \left( eN_{b}   \right)^{2}n_{bunch}\rho \int^{\infty}_{0} 2 d\omega \left| \lambda \left( \omega \right)  \right| ^{2}  \Re{}e \left( Z_{\parallel} \left( \omega\right)  \right).
\end{equation}

Next we make a change of the variable of integration $\omega = n_{bunch}\omega_{rev}$;

\begin{equation}
P_{loss}   =  \omega_{rev} \left( eN_{b}   \right)^{2}n_{bunch}^{2} \int^{\infty}_{0} 2 d\omega_{rev} \left| \lambda \left( \omega_{rev}n_{bunch} \right)  \right|^{2}  \Re{}e \left( Z_{\parallel} \left( \omega_{rev}n_{bunch}\right)  \right).
\end{equation}

We can subsequently change to a sum formalism to obtain

\begin{equation}
P_{loss} = \left( \omega_{rev}eN_{b}n_{bunch}  \right)^{2} \displaystyle\sum\limits_{p = 0}^{\infty} \left( 2 \left| \lambda \left(p \omega_{rev}n_{bunch} \right)  \right|^{2}  \Re{}e \left( Z_{\parallel} \left(p \omega_{rev}n_{bunch}\right) \right) \right) \label{ean:heating-gen}
\end{equation}

where $\omega_{0} = 2\pi f_{0}$, $f_{0} = \frac{1}{\tau_{b}}$ and $\tau_{b}$ is the bunch spacing.

\subsection{Longitudinal Beam Profiles}

As shown by the derivations in Section~\ref{sec:power_loss}, asides from the longitudinal impedance of the device under consideration the longitudinal profile of the circulating bunches also contributes to the power loss in the machine. In past works it has generally been assumed that bunches in accelerators have a Gaussian profile [ref Sacherer/Grudiev/Laclare](seen in Eqn.~\ref{eqn:gauss}, where $4\sigma_{z} = t_{b}$, $t_{b}$ is the bunch length) when approaching the analytical treatment of beam instabilities, both single-bunch and multi-bunch. Recent measurements of the power spectrum of particle beams, especially in the LHC [ref theo/phillipe] have shown characteristics that the Gaussian profile does not predict, for example the high frequency secondary peak as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:measured_gauss}. To make more realistic predictions of heat loss due to beam impedance in the machine it is thus necessary to find bunch profiles which reproduce this behaviour.

\begin{equation}
\lambda \left( t \right) = e^{\frac{-t^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}}
\label{eqn:gauss}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}

\label{fig:measured_gauss}
\end{figure}

A number of different longitudinal bunch profiles have been investigated in the past. Here we shall look at 3 other bunch profiles; a parabolic line density (see Eqn.~\ref{eqn:para_profile}), cos$^{2}$ (see Eqn.~\ref{eqn:cos_profile}), water-bag (see Eqn.~\ref{eqn:water_bag_profile}).

\begin{equation}
A\left( t \right) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} \lambda \left( \omega \right) e^{j\omega t} d\omega = 
\begin{cases}1-\left( \frac{2t} {t_{b}} \right)^{2} &\textrm{if $| t/2 | \leq t_{b}$}\\
0								&\textrm{if $| t/2 | > t_{b}$}
\end{cases}
\label{eqn:para_profile}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
A\left( t \right) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} \lambda \left( \omega \right) e^{j\omega t} d\omega = 
\begin{cases}
cos^{2}\left( \frac{\pi t} {t_{b}} \right) &\textrm{if $| t/2 | \leq t_{b}$}\\
0								&\textrm{if $| t/2 | > t_{b}$}
\end{cases}
\label{eqn:cos_profile}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
A\left( t \right) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} \lambda \left( \omega \right) e^{j\omega t} d\omega = 
\begin{cases}
\sqrt{1-\left( \frac{2t}{t_{b}}\right)^{2}} &\textrm{if $| t/2 | \leq t_{b}$}\\
0								&\textrm{if $| t/2 | > t_{b}$}
\end{cases}
\label{eqn:water_bag_profile}
\end{equation}

The comparison of these bunch profiles in the time domain are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:time_bunch_profiles}. Note all bunch currents are normalised to their peak value. The corresponding current and power spectrums are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:freq_dom_prof}. There are several things to note about these spectra; firstly that the non-infinite distribution of the non-gaussian bunch profiles gives rise to a number of high frequency lobes in the power spectrum, and secondly the interval of these nodes depends heavily on the bunch profile.

\caption{The frequency domain \ref{fig:current_spec} current spectrum and \ref{fig:power_spec} power spectrum for a number of different bunch profiles with a bunch length $\tau_{b} = 1.2ns$.}
\end{figure}

To illustrate more clearly the effect of changing the bunch length on the power spectrum, a number of bunch profiles and the corresponding power spectra with different bunch lengths are shown below. Firstly, consider a gaussian bunch profile. It can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:diff_bunch_len_gauss} that by increasing the bunch length that the magnitude at high frequencies is decreased quite substantially as the bunch length increases. If we consider a finite bunch profile (non-gaussian), we note that we have high frequency lobes. The peak frequency of these lobes depends on the bunch length, as illustrated using a parabolic bunch profile for bunch lengths $\tau_{b} = 1ns, 1.2ns, 1.4ns$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:diff_bunch_len_para}. As the bunch length is increased the lobes move to lower frequencies, and the width of the first branch decreases, as seen for the gaussian bunch. Similar behaviour is observed with the cos$^{2}$ and water-bag bunch profiles.

\caption{\ref{fig:change_len_time_para} The longitudinal profile and the \ref{fig:change_len_freq_para} associated bunch power spectrum for a number of bunch lengths assuming a parabolic bunch profile.}
\end{figure}

Finally, a comparison of a measured bunch power spectra and the analytical power spectra is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:power_all}. It can be seen that whilst it is possible to replicate some of the properties of the measured spectrum, an exact replication is non-trivial. Further investigation into the appropriate bunch profile is ongoing.

% Introduce a number of longitudinal profiles in time domain - gaussian, parabolic line density, cos^2, water bag - comments of realism (gaussian being infinite) - truncated gaussian
% Comparison in the frequency domain - firstly gaussian compared to truncated gaussian - infinite tails reduce the magnitude of the higher frequency components and lobe
% Gaussian, parabolic, cos^2 - all with the same bunch length
% Using the above examples try using a number of different bunch lengths to illustrate how they change (gaussian - just extends further, parabolic, cos^2 lobe frequency changes)
% Finally - comparison to measured spectra to illustrate changes in bunch length and frequency components as bunch is ramped and squeezed

\subsection{Beam induced heating due to a low Q impedance}

%% Example done with a low Q (Q ~ 1/10)
%% To illustrate effect of bunch length increase
%% Illustrate change with number of bunches (linear)

For an impedance with a characteristic Q that is small (Q $<$ 10), it can be seen that the impedance peak will interact substantially with a number of beam harmonics (see Fig.~\ref{fig:low_q_harmonics}) due to the broad frequency range it occupies.

The blue lines represent the frequency of a beam harmonic, not necessarily the magnitude of the power spectrum at that point. Note that a number of beam harmonics overlay non-zero impedance values.}
