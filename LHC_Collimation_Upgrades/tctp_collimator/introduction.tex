\section{TCTP Impedance Studies}

As part of the ongoing collimation upgrade in the LHC, several advances in the LHC design have been proposed. These are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{For the reasons given in Sec.~\ref{sec:phase-2-col-mat}, the jaw material of the collimators, specifically the secondary collimators is under review in an effort to reduce the beam impedance, improve cleaning efficiency and continue the present robustness and excellent performance of the LHC collimation system.}
\item{The inclusion of on collimator BPMs. This is due to the present method of alignment of the collimators relying on investigating the beam loss patterns in the LHC as a function of collimator aperture being a very time intensive procedure due to the inherentl slow natyure of beam loss. The use of on collimator BPMs allows a near instantaneous feedback on the position of the beam relative to the collimator jaw thus greatly increasing collimator setup time[cite setup paper gianluca/on collimator BPM paper]}
\item{A new RF system (Shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase-2-rf-system}) to reduce the side effects of the sliding RF contacts used in the phase 1 collimators.}
\end{enumerate}

As part of the upgrade, a series of TCTP collimators shall be installed in the LHC in replacement of a number of tertiary collimators (TCTs). In total, 8 TCTP and 1 TCSG will be added to the LHC. These collimators are in part intended to act as a test for two of these upgrades, the use of on collimator BPMs and the new RF system[cite collimators with onboard BPMs]. As part of the ongoing effort to limit increases to the LHC machine impedance (shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:lhc-impedance-budget})
