The author grew up in the south of the UK, leaving King Edward VI Grammar School in 2005 to read physics at the University of Southampton. In 2008 he was lucky enough to be selected for a summer studentship at CERN studying particle behaviour in the spectrometer of the 3MeV test bed for the Linac4 H- source. After graduating from Southampton in 2009 with an MPhys in Physics he went north to study for a PhD in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Manchester. He was able to acquire a Doctoral Studentship from the CERN Doctoral Student Programme and subsequently spent three exceptional years at CERN, Switzerland.
